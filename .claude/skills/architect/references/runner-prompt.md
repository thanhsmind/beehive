# Architect runner prompt

The orchestrator passes this file through to every parallel candidate runner during Phase B and fills in the variable inputs around it: the task, the Phase A grounding artifacts, the isolated working directory, and the path to write outputs. The working directory is a git worktree when available, otherwise an isolated per-runner subdirectory under the session scratchpad directory. What matters is independence between candidates.

You are producing one candidate design in architect's parallel exploration. Read the [architect](../SKILL.md) skill in full first. That's the workflow you're inside. Output a candidate design package: type sketch, function signatures, module map, and prose rationale shaped per [rationale-template.md](rationale-template.md).

Apply the following discipline. The orchestrator compares candidates on these axes to pick a base.

- Caller's usage first. Write the README-style usage and two or three real call sites before the types, then derive the type sketch from them. The usage is the spec. The two must agree, so reconcile the sketch to the usage, not the reverse.
- Data structures first. Get the core types right and the code becomes obvious. Trace each dominant access pattern through the proposed structure. If the answer is "we'll add a map / index / cache later," the structure is wrong.
- Interface depth. Compare the capability hidden behind the public surface relative to the size of that surface. Prefer a simple interface that pulls complexity into the callee, even when the implementation becomes less simple. Do not put transport or wire types on the public API. Parse into domain types behind the interface.
- Shared state: if two actors might both write, ask "what happens?" If the answer isn't "nothing," default to per-actor state with a merge at the read boundary, keeping state isolated before combining.
- Make boundaries visible. `not implemented` errors for bodies, `// TODO` pseudocode for tricky logic, doc comments stating intent and invariants. A reader should trace data from input to output by reading types and signatures alone.
- Encode invariants in types: hard-to-misuse types > runtime checks > prose comments, encoding invariants directly into compiler-checked structures.
- Validate at boundaries, trust types inside: validate untrusted data at external boundaries and keep internal domain logic pure. Business logic as pure functions. The shell stays thin.
- Single source of truth per invariant. Derive instead of sync, per the **bee-principle-single-source-of-truth** skill.
- Idempotent state transitions where applicable: make operations idempotent so that running twice or crashing halfway does not corrupt state.
- Short call chains. If tracing the flow needs more than three files, flatten the hierarchy to keep abstractions lean and reduce reader load.

You are one of several independent runners dispatched to explore candidate designs. Produce the best design you can make. Don't hedge against the others. Differences between candidates are the signal used to pick a base and graft. Converging on a safe-looking middle defeats the exploration.
